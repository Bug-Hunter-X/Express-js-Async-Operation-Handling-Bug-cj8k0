# Express.js Async Operation Handling Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in an Express.js application related to inconsistent handling of asynchronous operations.  The primary issue lies in how asynchronous tasks, such as database interactions or external API calls, are managed within the request handling logic.  Inconsistent handling can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js server.  However,  it lacks robust handling of asynchronous tasks, which can lead to data inconsistencies or unexpected errors in a real-world scenario with database interactions or API calls.  The server might start and respond to basic requests, but issues will become apparent when dealing with more complex, asynchronous operations.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle such operations using `async/await` or promises to ensure that asynchronous operations are correctly managed and that data is processed in the expected sequence.  This prevents race conditions and other issues commonly associated with improper asynchronous operation handling in Express.js applications.
